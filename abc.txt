February 10, 2015. After the market closed, Apple Inc. became the first company to have a market
valuation greater than $700 billion (see Exhibit 1a). Apple stock is riding high after selling a record
number of iPhones and showing a record $18 billion in quarterly profit.” These milestones are nota-
ble for Chief Executive Officer (CEQ) Tim Cook, for since he’s replaced the iconic Steve Jobs in 2011,
Apple's value has more than doubled—quieting skeptics. Mr. Cook has publicly rejected the “law of
large numbers” or the idea that growth rates slow as companies get bigger? So far, his instincts have
proven right: Demand for Apple products has intensified, particularly in China. Because increasing
sales or profits by 10 percent for $10 million ($1 million) is a lot easier than growing the same amount
from a base of $18 billion ($180 million), maintaining double-digit growth can be difficult. Despite the
sticcess of former innovations, under Steve Jobs, that growth often came from the “next big thing.”
From where will continued growth now come? Such is what Tim Cook anticipates investors will also
wonder (see Exhibit 1b for a comparison of Apple's share price to the NASDAQ 100 Index).*

The Creation of Apple Inc.

In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak conceived the idea of a personal-computer company and
founded Apple Computer Inc. (computer was dropped in 2007 to reflect Apple's expansion from the
personal computer market to general consumer electronics)’ At just 21 years of age, Jobs sold his
Volkswagen to fund the start of the company. Jobs and Wozniak, then 26, began to assemble personal
computers in Jobs’ garage with a small group of friends. Soon after, they received additional financing
to spur the growth of the company. In 1978, the Apple II, the first personal computer, was launched and
sold for $666.66.% In December of that same year, Apple launched a successful IPQ (initial public offer-
ing), making it a publicly traded company. Since its IPO, Apple's market value has risen an astounding
50,600 percent”

By 1980, Apple had released three improved versions of the personal computer, and Jobs and
Wozniak had become multimillionaires. The following year, IBM entered the personal computer mar-
ket and quickly became a serious competitor. IBM's open architecture was easily imitable by other
manufacturers and soon became the industry standard, giving rise to many more computer compa-
nies in the United States (e.g., Compaq and Dell), as well as in Taiwan, Korea, and other Asian coun-
tries. Even more threatening was the consortium among IBM, which specialized in the development
of computer hardware; the newly formed Microsoft with its DOS operating system; and Intel with its

expertise in memory and processors. By 1982, IBM had increased its profitability and market share sub-
stantially, and Apple's position was under attack. Apple responded two years later with the Macintosh,
which offered advanced capabilities with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), and which iid
introduced via a dramatic television commercial during the third quarter of the 1984 Super Bowl? In
1985, Steve Jobs was forced out after a pare struggle with CEO John Sculley, a professional manager
from Pepsi who was hired two years prior.” Steve Jobs had to watch as the company he founded fell on
hard times. By 1996, Apple reported a mere $69 million in first-quarter revenue and massive layoffs of
30 percent of the company’s total work force of 13,400.°

Steve Jobs Returns

After his public firing from Apple, Steve Jobs pursued other interests (NeXT and Pixar). Applet 8
purchase of NeXT on December 20, 1996, for $429 million opened a way for Steve's return to Apple.
Jobs became CEO again in 1997 and took only a symbolic $1 salary. He later reminisced, “I didn't see it
then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened
to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again. . . .
It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.”'? Apple largely survived based on a
$150 million investment from Microsoft in August 1997; the intent was to keep Apple and its operating
system viable to avoid monopoly antitrust concerns.” However, it gave Steve Jobs needed time to have
Apple develop products that shaped future technology and to orchestrate one of the greatest corporate
comebacks in modern-day history.

Steve Jobs firmly believed that Apple could create major innovation breakthroughs that would
reshape future industries. Jobs’ attitude toward innovation as key to a successful strategy and competi-
tive advantage was revealed in an interview with UCLA professor Richard Rumelt shortly after Jobs
returned to Apple in 1998:

1 was interested in what Steve Jobs might say about the future of Apple. His survival strategy for Apple,
for all its skill and drama, was not going to propel Apple into the future. At that moment in time, Apple
had less than 4 percent of the personal-computer market. The de facto standard was Windows-Intel [later
“Wintel”] and there seemed to be no way for Apple to do more than just hang on to a tiny niche. I said,
“Steve, this turnaround at Apple has been impressive. But everything we know about the PC business says
that Apple cannot really push beyond a small niche position. The network effects are just too strong to
upset the Wintel standard. So what are you going to do in the longer term? What is your strategy?”

[Steve Jobs] did not attack my argument. He didn't agree with it either. He just smiled and said, “I'm going
to wait for the next big thing.”

(See Exhibits 2 and 3 product, geographic and financial performance).

Restructuring Apple

When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he was ready and eager to shake things up. In a meet-
ing with Apple's top executives, after hearing all their explanations as to why Apple was performing
poorly, Jobs infamously roared: “The products SUCK! There's no SEX in them anymore!" Jobs swiftly
refocused the company that he had helped start and discontinued several products such as the Newton

Apple Inc.

PDA, the LaserWriter printer line, and the Apple QuickTake camera—all now collector items for Apple
enthusiasts.

During this time of restructuring, Jobs outsourced manufacturing to Taiwan and scaled down the
distribution system by ending relationships with smaller outlets. With Jobs’ savvy insight for what con-
sumers wanted, he launched a new, revolutionary website to sell Apple products directly to customers
online. For the first time ever, he also opened Apple retail stores, tied to his build-to-order manufactur-
ing strategy. Although these moves seemed risky at the time, all of these operational improvements
helped to boost previously declining sales. For the first time in five years (since 1993), Apple once again
became profitable.

Jobs also realized the necessity of making Apple's operating system more accessible for software
providers. He switched everything to the open-source, UNIX-based operating system, Mac OS X.
This proved to be a more stable operating environment and permitted the company to issue annual
upgrades in response to customer feedback. In 2005, Apple completed this transition by switching from
PowerPC to Intel processors, which meant that Apple computers could run not only the Mac OS X but
also any operating systems that used the x86 architecture. This marked the beginning of a truly open
era for Apple computers: They were now the most flexible, as well as the most attractive. As a result,
Apple's stock price rose from $6 in 2003 to over $80 in 2006, surpassing even Dell's market cap, the
then-number-one computer maker in the United States.’® Dell's CEO, Michael Dell, was left retracting
the words he had very publicly spat nine years prior, “If I ran Apple, I would shut it down and give the
money back to shareholders."

Beyond changing the operating system, the most visible change Jobs instituted was leveraging
industrial design to produce more aesthetically pleasing computers. Jobs almost instantly revitalized
Apple's image by pushing the limits of technology and design. He appointed Jonathan Ive, a British
designer, head of Apple’s in-house Industrial Design group (IDg). There have been several distinct
design themes in Jobs and lIve's collaboration over the years: translucency, colors, minimalism, and
dark aluminum. Ive has been credited with being the chief designer of the iMac, the aluminum and
titanium PowerBook G4, the MacBook, unibody MacBook Pro, the iPod, iPhone, and iPad." Ive’s work
at Apple has won him a slew of awards and widespread recognition.

Jobs also started to brand Apple as a functionally appealing, hip alternative to other dull, clone-
like computers in the market. Known for his candor, Steve Jobs once accused Michael Dell of making
“un-innovative beige boxes.”'” Continuing in the same vein as the now well-known 1984 television
ad, Apple launched its “Think Different” campaign in 1997. The aim of the campaign was to reflect
the culture of Apple, which comprised great people who think differently. The television advertise-
ments featured major artists, scientists, and politicians who were seen as independent thinkers, includ-
ing Albert Einstein, Martin Luther King, Jr, John Lennon, Thomas Edison, Amelia Earhart, Alfred
Hitchcock, Pablo Picasso, and Jerry Seinfeld. Similarly, Apple's print advertisements had less to do
with specific products, and everything to do with company image. They simply featured a portrait of
one of the historic figures and a small Apple logo with the words “Think Different” in the bottom cor-
ner. In 2002, Apple launched the “Switch” advertising campaign, which showed various celebrities and
non-celebrities talking about the reasons they switched from Windows computers to Apple computers.
The “I'm a Mac, I'm a PC” commercials in the last half of the decade, which featured young actor Justin
Long as a “Mac” and a middle-aged man (comic John Hodgman) in a suit as a “PC,” helped to fortify
the image of the Mac as young and hip and the PC as only suitable for business and not the creative
needs of the younger generation.

Apple's Culture

As early as 1983, Steve Jobs coined the following motto at an offsite retreat: “It’s better to be a pirate
than join the navy.”?” Jobs’ Macintosh team had only 80 employees at the time, but already he sensed
that they were developing the group-think mentality that he detested. In response to “Captain” Jobs’
cry, programmers Steve Capps and Susan Kare painted a rainbow-colored Apple eye patch onto a
pirate flag and hung it above the Macintosh building. This iconic image became illustrative of Apple's
unique corporate culture and also symbolic of Apple's first inspired slogan in the late 1970s, “Byte into
an Apple.”

According to its website, working at Apple was “less of a job, more of a calling.” Apple looked for
employees who were on a mission to “change the world” and create “some of the best-loved technol-
ogy on the planet”? Apple promoted itself to prospective candidates as “a whole different thing” with
“corporate jobs without the corporate part.”* Apple looked for people who were “smart, creative, up
for any challenge, and incredibly excited about what they do. In other words, Apple people. You know,
the kind of people you'd want to hang around with anyway.”?* From the start, Steve Jobs had been
more than instrumental in developing Apple's envied corporate culture. Employees typically worked
60 to 70 hours a week, and no one complained.

Apple has been thought of as putting Silicon Valley on the map with its hard-working but relaxed,
casual atmosphere.”® This characterization would be an impossible contradiction in most other corpo-
rations in the United States, but not at Apple. When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he became famous
for his standard black turtleneck and jeans uniform, walking around the campus with, or sometimes
without, his sneakers. Jobs even went barefoot to a 1999 meeting to settle a patent dispute with execu-
tives from Microsoft.® Jobs was the ultimate example of an “I'm-a-genius-and-I-don’t-care” attitude.
Apple employees embraced their hero and became convinced that, with confidence and creativity, they
too could become rich and leave a legacy—sans suit or shoes.

Apple's rebel spirit not only attracted a long-lasting appreciation from loyal employees but also
created an almost cult-like following among customers who appreciated Apple's propensity to think
differently. Millions of people wanted to be seen as unique individuals, and hence, millions of people
bought Apple products. The “Cult of Apple” was a group of rumored fanatical followers devoted to
all things Apple, but “while there are many customers who eat, think, and breathe Apple, members of
the Cult of Apple take their devotion one step further and believe in Apple.”* The result was that Apple
had a conspicuous horde-like following walking down the streets of every major city in the world with
the signature white ear buds of Apple products attached to their heads. Apple products became so
trendy that other companies had to design their consumer electronics like Apple's to have a hope of
selling. The loyalty of Apple customers has served the company well, and now it is not just the die-hard
fanatics who believe. Even people in the mainstream were becoming Apple converts.

Innovation at Apple under Steve Jobs: iPod/iPhone/iPad

The one competency thatkept Apple on the cutting edge, all the way from startup to survival and suc-
cess, has been innovation that others envy. “Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower,”
Jobs repeatedly said.” Jobs believed that innovation is a process that can be cultivated and managed
within an organization. If begins with idea generation, then moves to idea adoption and development,

Apple Inc.

and finally to idea implementation. All the while, the innovation process has been enabled by effective
leadership and a supportive organizational culture.

Apple's top management was also critical in the effort to nurture an innovative organization because
employees needed to know that they would notbe reprimanded for making risky choices when attempt-
ing a creative project. A high tolerance for failure and calculated risk-taking is necessary for employees
to feel comfortable bringing up new ideas in any organization.” Apple's work force appeared to have
embraced this attitude fully, as they proudly “[said] NO to 1,000 things.”

Compared to its competitors, Apple spends less, but an increasing amount, on research and devel-
opment (R&D) with expenses of $6.0 billion, $4.5 billion, and $3.4 billion in 2014, 2013, and 2012 respec-
tively, which ranges between 2.2 to 3.3 percent of revenues (see Exhibit 4). Comparing the amount of
money spent at Apple with that of other technology giants shows how effectively Apple's innovation
process works, making possible a significant return on R&D investment. In fact, Jobs was known to say:
“Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the
Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R&D. It's not about money. It’s about the people you
have, how you're led, and how much you ‘get it.”"** (See Exhibit 5a for a historical timeline of Apple’s
product introductions and net income.)

THE iPOD

The big bang happened at Apple in October 2001 with the launch of the iPod, a portable digital
music player based on the MP3 music format. The sleek design and smart graphical user interface
bewitched consumers. The product was an instant hit, selling over 100 million units within six years.
The profitability of the iPod was phenomenal, with margins estimated as high as 47.4 percent before
freight, marketing, and other costs.™

In April 2003, Apple provided iTunes as a complement for the iPod. iTunes was the first online store
from which customers could buy songs individually at 99 cents each, rather than purchasing entire
albums for upward of $15 to $20 or downloading songs illegally. Within three days of launch, iTunes
users had downloaded one million songs. By June 2008, iTunes had exceeded five billion downloads. *
On February 25, 2010, which was coincidentally Steve Jobs’ 55th birthday, Apple achieved the great
milestone of 10 billion iTunes downloaded. Apple had seemingly effortlessly established itself as the
newest icon of the digital age, revolutionizing the music industry and holding fast to its leadership
position in the technology race.

In keeping with its iconoclastic reputation, Apple promoted its iPod as a stylish alternative to
archetypal music technology products with the new “iPod People” campaign. Ads featured several
silhouetted people with white headphones in their ears dancing against a colorful background. Apple
advertising had always been creative by design, but its “iPod People” promotion brought in an unmis-
takable “coolness-factor” as the essence of the product. That desired attribute was directly transferred
to the customer upon purchase.

THE iPHONE

In June 2007, Apple launched the iPhone, and soon Apple's share price passed the $100 mark.* The
iPhone was a multifunction smartphone that provided the customer with a unique touch-based inter-
face and a revolutionary operating system delivering a computer-based experience. According to Jobs,

Apple Inc.

the iPhone was “the Internet in your pocket.”¥” Apple partnered with AT&T to bring this device to the
market and make it affordable for consumers. AT&T was happy to subsidize the phones, as long as it
could ride the Apple wave of “coolness” and innovation.

One year later, Apple launched the iPhone 3G, which was advertised as twice as fast at half the
price. The iPhone 3G supported all Microsoft document formats and had full support for a Microsoft
Exchange server. Apple sold a record six million 3G iPhones in the first year, giving birth to a whole
new generation of smartphones. In the summer of 2010, Apple released the iPhone 4 with two built-in
cameras and higher resolutions. In that same year, Apple had captured 17.4 percent of the smartphone
market, with 82 percent sales growth since 2008. It had taken only two years for Apple to jump to sec-
ond place behind Nokia, with 32.7 percent market share. The iPhone 4S, an update to the iPhone 4 with
a voice assistant known as “Siri,” was released in October of 2011. The iPhone 5, which had a larger
screen and was the first 4G iPhone, was released in September of 2012. The iPhone 6 represented more
of an update and included the iPhone 6 Plus to better compete with larger phones from Samsung. The
larger size enabled better battery life, and it came with a better camera. However, combined with the
thin size the larger area raised problems with the iPhone 6 bending.*® As of early 2015, only 15 percent
of customers have updated to the iPhone 6 providing room for additional sales.”

THE iPAD

On January 25,2010, Jobs took his biggest gamble yet with the announcement of the iPad, a multime-
dia, tablet-style computer designed to take the place of a pencil and pad of paper.*’ (See Exhibit 5a for
a historical timeline of Apple's product introductions and net income.) The iPad ranks among the most
successful product launches ever, taking it only 28 days (compared to 74 for the iPhone 3) to sell more
than 1 million units! The idea of a keyboard-free, touchscreen portable computer tablet had been
around for more than two decades. Apple had even launched its own Newton MessagePad in 1993,
which became known less for its pioneering features and more for being ridiculed in “Doonesbury”
for the software’s problem in recognizing handwriting. ** At half-an-inch thick, weighing 1.5 pounds,
with a 9.7-inch “gorgeous, super-high quality display” and that was “multi-touch, super-responsive,
and super-precise,” Apple had come a long way since the Newton.” The iPad offers Wi-Fi wireless
connectivity—enabling access to e-mail, photos, video, music, games, and e-books, as well as browsing
the web. Additionally, the iPad incorporates features like a calendar, photo manager, spreadsheets, and
presentations to take on a more multimedia look.**

There was concern the iPad would cannibalize sales of other Apple products, but Jobs believed there
was room for a third category between the laptop and smartphone, but acknowledged that “it must do
things far better than both existing devices.” Jobs argued that if the iPad could not do some tasks better
than laptops or smartphones, it was unnecessary.*® Unlike the iPhone, the initial iPad lacked a built-in
camera for taking photos. While Jobs hailed the iPad as “a dream to type on,” for many it was not as
easy as a typical keyboard with tactile keys to feel. This caused many customers to express disappoint-
ment with the iPad as doing less than the iPhone, but on a bigger screen.’®,*” In March 2011, Steve Jobs,
in typical showman fashion, unveiled the iPad2, a thinner and sleeker but higher-performing version
of the original iPad. The iPad? also contained two cameras to facilitate online video chat

With the introduction of the iPad, Apple increasingly became a mobile-devices company, competing
against Sony, Samsung, and Nokia.* At the same time, Apple faced direct competition from other com-
puter manufacturers, who were quick to jump on the iPad bandwagon, hoping to undercut Apple's
price to gain market share. For example, Hewlett-Packard announced its own keyboardless computer
called the “Slate,” and Dell, Acer, and Sony were all refining their own versions of the tablet. In addi-

Apple Inc.

tion, the iPad has faced increased competition from the new mini-laptops or “netbooks.” By the time
the iPad turned five in 2015, competing products in the form of tablets and larger phones led to the first
annual decline in tablet sales and iPad sales fell almost 18 percent.*® (Exhibit 5b shows Apple’s product
sales by category, 2006-2014).

Tim Cook, Apple's New CEO

After going on his second medical leave in two years following a liver transplant in 2009, Steve Jobs
put Tim Cook in charge.” Tim Cook was appointed CEO on August 24, 2011. A few weeks later, on
October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs lost his battle with cancer.

Tim Cook, who had an MBA from Duke University and a BS in Industrial Engineering from Auburn
University, had been Apple's Chief Operating Officer (COQ) since 2007. He directed the outsourcing
for most of Apple's production in a business where obsolescence can decrease the value of unsold
goods by 2 percent a week.” While Tim Cook's leadership style clearly differs from that of Steve Jobs,
Cook’s attempt to balance things out reflects a keen awareness of Jobs’ impact on Apple. To keep a bal-
ance of the two styles of leadership, Cook kept Jobs’ office exactly how he left it, but also enacted initia-
tives to signal that someone different was in charge. Tim Cook’s first initiative was something Steve
opposed: matching Apple employee charitable donations up to $10,000 a year.” Cook also announced
that the company would begin paying a dividend in 2012.

Maintaining Apple's success without Steve Jobs was alone a singular challenge, but so was main-
taining innovation. In 2011 Apple's most noticeable product changes involved color—popular prod-
ucts were now being offered in white. In 2012, Apple released the iPhone 5, which was thinner than
previous iPhones and had a larger screen. The new iPhone smashed pre-order records, but the release
was marred by the replacement of Google maps with Apple software, leading to the firing of Scott
Forstall, the head of mobile software. Forstall had clashed with other executives, and Steve Jobs was
not there to mediate.> Tim Cook continues to face the challenges of maintaining a management team
and continuing to release innovative products. These challenges are reflected in the fact that Tesla,
which promises to maintain a culture like what Steve Jobs had created, has attracted more than 150
former Apple employees.”

INEXT?

An area where the loss of Steve Jobs is still keenly felt is product innovation. Since 2010, with the
debut of the iPad, Apple has not introduced a new flagship product. Introducing new products to
maintain continued revenue growth and profitability is an evident concern for Tim Cook. He appears
to be trying to leverage Apple's flagship product the iPhone, as well as developing new products.
Following are brief descriptions of Apple's current efforts.

BEATS HEADPHONES

In 2014, Apple acquired Beats Electronics for $3 billion and will maintain it as a separate brand
Beats was co-founded by rapper Dr. Dre and its headphones and speakers emphasize bass or hearing
music as artists do. Prior to its acquisition, Beats Electronics had over $1 billion in sales. Beats head-
phones and portable speakers serve as complements to iPhones and iPods by delivering a superior
sound for music.

Apple Inc.

APPLE WATCH

In early 2015, Apple announced that it would begin selling the Apple Watch in April. Originally
envisioned as a health-monitoring device, many of those functions did not make it in the initial product
and it is unclear what consumer need the Apple Watch will fill.” The Apple Watch costs $350 dollars
for the entry model, and it only works with an iPhone. The watch’s most obvious function is enabling
amore discrete method of checking who is calling or texting a person.® The Apple smartwatch is posi-
tioned to be a luxury fashion accessory, with the 18-carat gold version version priced around $17,000.”

APPLE PAY

Apple's approach to mobile payment is called Apple Pay. While currently a small part of Apple's
revenues, Apple Pay accounts for two-thirds of rapidly growing mobile payments.®* The number of
companies accepting payments is limited to the United States. However, even though Apply Pay was
accepted by only 15 companies in 2014, it was projected to grow to 53 by 2015. Still, Apple Pay contin-
ues to depend on consumers conjointly using their iPhone 6 or iPhone 5 with Apple Watch.

APPLE TV In March 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the first-generation Apple TV to the world, having
referred to it more as a “hobby” than a mainstream product. The first-generation model was a box that
connected to a user’s television set. It allowed the user to sync and then play his or her downloaded
content from the iTunes Store. The content could be rewound or fast-forwarded, making the Apple TV
the equivalent of the modern-day satellite or cable DVR.The 2012 generation of the Apple TV provided
users with more flexibility to view content from their iPhone, iPad, or iPod. Additionally, users can
watch movies, play music, show off their videos and photos, and even mirror what's on their device's
screen to enjoy games, web pages, and more. Ultimately, Apple TV allows users to access all of the
benefits of their complementary Apple products from their living rooms. The latest generation model
retails for $99. However, the complexity of dealing and integrating with established broadcast cable
providers and hardware design and supply issues have held back Apple TV. Even with these holdups,
Apple continues to have an “intense interest” in television, and the company continues to test high-
definition TVs and possible partnerships with cable companies. There are consistent rumors about an
Apple-branded television (iTV), but the anticipated timelines continue to shift without an official prod-
uct. The biggest hint about an Apple TV came from the 2011 biography on Steve Jobs that indicated
Apple solved the television interface concept for a dedicated Apple television set. In 2013, Apple's
acquisition of PrimeSense, the company behind the technology of Microsoft's Kinect motion-control
sensor for its Xbox, implied it wanted to change how people interacted with televisions.”

APPLE CAR

Apple's latest rumored project is an electric car under the code name “Titan” that resembles a mini-
van.® Electric vehicles are costly to build and Apple's efforts lag behind those of another Silicon Valley
firm, Tesla. The cost and performance of batteries for electric vehicles and the lack of an established
standard limit the acceptance of electric cars; in 2014, Nissan's Leaf led the market with just 40,000
cars sold.” Further, the automobile industry has higher rivalry that relates to lower industry profit-
ability. Ford and Nissan understand the automobile industry well and have opened research labs in
Silicon Valley.%® It is also worth noting that several companies are developing driverless cars, including
Google, which revealed a prototype in 2014.% However, government regulations, questions of liability
for crashes, and questions of customer acceptance slow progress on automated cars.

Apple Inc.

Current Competitors

Apple's exceptional performance, brand loyalty, and innovation capabilities would make any CEO
envious. Also, as the industry continues to evolve, the lines between hardware, software, and search
engines have blurred as each company vies for market share and dominance. The following companies
pose the biggest threat to Apple and consistently seek opportunities to take market share away from
the industry giant. (See Exhibit 6 comparing Apple's monthly stock performance versus selected com-
petitors between January 2010 and January 2015.)

AMAZON.COM

Founded in 1994 by Jeffrey Bezos as an online book retailer, Amazon's sales grew from $20,000 in
1995 to over $74 billion in 2013. After the company went public in 1997, it rapidly diversified into
multiple product areas, undercutting existing specialty and bricks-and-mortar retailers in price.%® In
1998, Amazon launched its online music and video store and began to sell toys as well as consumer
electronics; it added clothing in 2002. More recently, Amazon has engaged in a series of acquisitions to
further expand the breadth of products offered. The firm acquired the number one online shoe retailer,
Zappos, for $890 million in 2009. In 2010, Amazon added both Woot, a social shopping e-commerce
site, and Quidsi, the owner of Diapers.com and Soap.com, to its portfolio. By 2012, Amazon employed
51,300 people all over the world and had climbed to number 56 in the Fortune 500.%

The Kindle Fire tablet product line is seen as a direct competitor to the iPad. In January 2013, the
Kindle Fire accounted for 7.78 percent of web traffic from tablet computers in North America compared
to the iPad’s 81 percent.”” The Kindle Fire runs Google's Android operating system and the Kindle
Fire HD was announced in September 2012 and comes in two different sizes: 7 inches and 8.9 inches.
However, Amazon's share of the tablet market remains low with a 2.3 percent market share and an
annual decline of almost 70 percent between 2013 and 2014.” Separately, Amazon's Fire Phone that
launched in 2014 was not a success.

Apple's iBookstore competes with Amazon's Kindle, and Apple set the maximum e-book price at
the cost of printing the book, so publishers were able to charge anywhere from $12.99 to $14.99 for most
titles. Apple retained 30 percent of the sale price and returned the remaining 70 percent to the publish-
ers. The aspect that appealed to publishers was that they were able to determine the prices of e-content,
and this gave them leverage to negotiate higher prices for their content with Amazon. It was even pos-
sible that publishers would withhold titles from Amazon if they did not agree to raise their prices. As
a result, the competition between Apple and Amazon “Is as intense a situation as the industry has ever
had. ... It's a huge chess match.””

GOOGLE

In 1998, 24-year-old Sergey Brin and 25-year-old Larry Page founded Google. They met as gradu-
ate students in the computer science department at Stanford University where they began working
together on a web crawler, with the goal of improving online searches. What they developed was the
PageRank algorithm, which returns the most relevant web pages more or less instantaneously and
ranks them by how often they are referenced on other important web pages. A clear improvement over
early search engines such as AltaVista, Overture, and Yahoo, all of which were indexed by keywords,

Apple Inc,

the PageRank algorithm is able to consider 500 million variables and three billion terms. What started
as a homework assignment launched the two into an entrepreneurial venture when they set up shop in
a garage in Menlo Park, California.

Today, Google is the world’s leading online search and advertising company, with some 70 percent
market share of an industry estimated to be worth more than $25 billion a year, and growing quickly.
Google's current operating system, Android, is used exclusively by Samsung Electronics, a Korean
electronics maker, in all of its smartphone devices. As an alternative to the iPhone, Android phones
created by Samsung, HTC, and others have rapidly stolen market share from Apple and BlackBerry.
Samsung especially has been able to create phones running Android that are viable alternatives to the
iPhone. In a move into the hardware space, Google acquired Motorola Mobility in 2011 and plans to
release its own phones and tablets running Android. Google would have more control over the hard-
ware and ideally be able to optimize the hardware for future Android features. By controlling the soft-
ware on mobile devices, Google plans to also control the ads shown to users, thus extending its hold on
the digital ads market, its main source of revenue. Android's market share in smartphones worldwide
has grown from over 50 percent in 2011 to over 84 percent in 2014.” Google is also moving into mobile
payments with Wallet; however, Google has less control over how its operating system is used and
retailers have been slow to adopt the system.”

Google's Chromebook is a line of laptop computers running Google's Chrome operating system.
The Chrome OS is designed to provide the user with the minimal amount of hardware and installed
applications needed. The user runs applications from the cloud and uses Google's Chrome browser to
access these applications. Several manufacturers such as Samsung, Acer, and HP are partnering with
Google to create Chromebooks.

Google is also looking to develop more web-connected services for people's homes, powered by
the Android operating system. In addition, Google is trying to enter the high-speed Internet market
so it can deliver its products to customers without having to worry about poor connection speeds or
being blocked by competitors. In 2012, it began wiring homes in Kansas City, both the Missouri and
Kansas sides, with plans to expand to other locations around the United States in 2013.” Google is also
attempting to hold off both Facebook and Amazon by enabling retailers to reach consumers through
its search engine exclusively.

MICROSOFT

The partnership that Paul Allen and Bill Gates formed in 1975 started out small, but Gates had a
vision to one day put a computer in everyone's home. During the next several decades, their company,
Microsoft, revolutionized the way people worked and played on their computers, as Microsoft domi-
nated the technology market with its Windows operating system in the 1990s and early 2000s.” The
explosion of mobile devices led by Apple has Microsoft playing catch-up.

To compete with the iPad, Microsoft released its Surface tablet in October of 2012 with a large cam-
paign focused on comparing it to the iPad. The Surface has an attachable keyboard /cover, a USB port,
and runs the Windows 8 operating system. Furthering Microsoft's presence in the smartphone market
was Apple's acquisition of Nokia devices and services in 2014 for more than $7 billion. This acquisition
returned Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop to Microsoft as an executive vice president of the Microsoft Devices
Group—the same group responsible for Lumia smartphones and tablets, Nokia mobile phones, Xbox
hardware, Surface, and other products.”

Apple Ine.

Like Apple, Microsoft has opened its own stores to sell Microsoft and third-party products that
run Microsoft's software. The company is also working on an update to its Windows operating sys-
tem—causing it to skip from the number 9 to the number 10 version in an attempt to emphasize the
significance of the upgrade. Microsoft plans to use Windows 10 across all its products (computers,
tablets, phones, and Xbox).”® It has also announced plans to offer free customer upgrades to Windows
10, which can boost their operating systems market share; this move suggests a shift in its business
model—one that may rely more on annual subscriptions for upgrades.”

SAMSUNG

On March 1, 1938, Byung-Chull Lee started Samsung, which means three stars in Korean, as a small
export business focusing primarily on fish, vegetables, and fruit. Within a little over 10 years, Samsung
would have its own manufacturing and sales operations. Today, the technology giant sells products
around the globe and is instantly recognized for its innovative, consumer-driven products.®’ By 2012,
Samsung Electronics had become the global smartphone market leader, due mostly to its extremely
successful Galaxy S device and subsequent versions, which run on Google's Android operating system.
The phone is comparable in both design and technical features to the iPhone and poses the biggest
competitive threat to Apple. It is estimated that Samsung holds roughly 24 percent of the smartphone
market, down from 32 percent in 2013, while Apple’s global market share has fallen to approximately
12 percent in 2014.5

Together, Samsung hardware and Google software have combined to provide a product comparable
in quality and experience to the iPhone. Competition between Apple and Samsung is extending into
mobile payments by offering LoopPay that works with over 10,000 banks.*> One of the main drivers of
Samsung's rise has been its two-pronged pricing structure. Its premium products are priced similarly
to Apple's in the United States, but the company also heavily discounts the prices of some phones,
sometimes to less than a quarter of the suggested retail price. Additionally, Samsung manufactures
all of its own smartphones, including the components, which gives it a distinct cost advantage over
its closest competitors. Even Apple uses Samsung to manufacture a portion of its iPhone product line.
For the low-end and emerging smartphone markets, Samsung also provides a competitive lower cost.

The intense competition between Apple and Samsung has led to many legal battles, mostly over pat-
ent infringement. In August 2012, a U.S. federal court ruled in favor of Apple in one such case, award-
ing it more than $1 billion in damages (later reduced to some $500 million). Separate infringement cases
are pending in various other countries around the world pertaining to the design and technology of
both companies’ devices.

Challenges Ahead

Despite Apple's incredible performance over the last few years, Tim Cook knows all too well that
Apple faces significant challenges. Perhaps Apple's greatest challenge involves investors and consum-
ers having big expectations. Despite Tim Cook dismissing the “law of big numbers,” it remains to be
seen from where the continued growth will come. In Apple's record-breaking quarter at the end of
2014, the popular iPhone accounted for two-thirds of its $74.6 billion in revenue ® This largely came
from success in selling iPhones in China; however, new sales to customers there and in established

11
Apple Inc.

markets will require convincing people with smartphones to replace them or buy products to comple-
ment them. For example, the Apple Watch represents an accessory to a device that performs existing
functions well, and it is unclear why consumers will need or want the device.

Again we ask, from where will expected growth come? Will it involve a combination of products
or something entirely new, or new markets? In addition to success in China, Apple could pursue sales
in other emerging economies, such as India or Brazil. How should Apple compete in these markets?
Apple also needs to potentially be concerned about Chinese government policies that may impact it.
Any setback in China would hurt Apple. Moreover, Apple’s success has invited competition that is con-
stantly looking at new ways to take market share away from the company. How should Cook respond
to competitive pressure? Further, Apple's success has brought the attention of activist investors that
want its $178 billion in cash returned as dividends or used to buy back shares.®

Tim Cook has some enormous strategic decisions to make in the short term, and he needs to decide
where and how Apple should compete in the long term. Given the blurring industry boundaries that
allow capable competitors to put pressure on Apple, Cook needs to carefully plan the company’s next
moves if he wants to sustain Apple's competitive advantage and growth. As his MacBook Pro boots up,
Cook pops open a can of Diet Mountain Dew and begins to jot down some of his thoughts.
